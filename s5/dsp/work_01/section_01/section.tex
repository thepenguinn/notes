\section{Introduction} \label{sec:wrkFrequencyAnalysisIntro}

Generate $3$ frequencies, $X$, $2X$ and $2X.1$. Then find the DFT and DTFT of
the combined signal and identify the frequency components. Try with $4$
different sampling frequencies. One is $4X$, other one slightly greater than
$4X$, one much greater than $4X$ and one much less than $4X$. For the DFT,
select $N = 32$. In the sampled signal, with $N = 32$, zero pad with another 32
zeroes and find the 64 point DFT and DTFT. Write your comments about frequency
analysis from the results. $X$ will be your class number. Python or Matlab can
be used for this assignment.
