\def\abstractcontent {
    This paper analyse various \emph{parameters} that affect the \emph{generation}
    of \textsc{dtft}s and \textsc{dft}s and tries to find an \emph{optimal} mix of
    all of these \emph{parameters} in giving a good \emph{frequency spectrum} that
    \emph{carries} the \emph{sufficient spectral information} to \emph{reconstruct}
    or \emph{interpolate back} the \emph{original input signal}.

    It is found that the \emph{zero padding} and taking a \emph{higher point}
    \textsc{transform} does \emph{enhance} the \textsc{dft}s but \emph{not so much} in
    the case of \textsc{dtft}s. In both the \textsc{transform}s, \emph{increasing}
    the \emph{sample count} and taking a \emph{higher point} \textsc{transform} seems
    to \emph{increase} the \emph{frequency resolution}.

    It is also found that these \textsc{transform}s only \emph{carry} \emph{spectral
    information} upto \emph{half} the \emph{sampling frequency}. The other half
    \emph{mirrors} the first half. \emph{Increasing} just the \emph{sampling frequency}
    can also \emph{negatively} affect the \textsc{transform} if \emph{sample count} is
    not \emph{sufficient}.

    The \emph{real} and the \emph{imaginary} parts of the \textsc{transform}s are
    found to be crucial in \emph{reconstructing} the \emph{input signal}, as together they
    carry the \emph{amplitude} and \emph{phase} information.
