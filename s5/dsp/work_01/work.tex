    Generated $3$ frequencies, $X$, $2X$ and $2X.1$. And found the DFT and DTFT of
    the combined signal and identified their \emph{frequency components}. Tried with $4$
    different \emph{sampling frequencies}. One is $4X$, other one \emph{slightly greater} than
    $4X$, one \emph{much greater} than $4X$ and one \emph{much less} than $4X$. For the DFT,
    selected $N = 32$. In the sampled signal, with $N = 32$, \emph{zero padded} with another $32$
    \emph{zeroes} and found the $64$ point DFT and DTFT. And $X$ was taken as $28$. This
    analysis is computed using \textsc{python} and the plots are plotted using \LaTeX's
    \textsc{pgfplots} package.
